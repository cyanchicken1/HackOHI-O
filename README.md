# gOSU
Smart Transit Assistant

A smart transit app for The Ohio State University that finds the fastest bus route from A to B, powered by live API data.

The Problem:

For students, faculty, and visitors, the existing campus bus system is hard to navigate. It requires too much time and thinking: you have to find your building, find the nearest stop, find the right bus, check the live map, and then guess if it's faster than just walking. The real user need isn't "Where is the bus?" â€” it's "What is the fastest way to get to my destination right now?"

Our Solution:

gOSU is a personal transit assistant that does the thinking for you. Instead of just showing you dots on a map, our app:

Takes your start and end location.

Runs a smart algorithm using live bus ETAs.

Calculates the single fastest, end-to-end trip, including all walk, wait, and ride times.

Compares this to the total walk time, so you always know the best option.

Key Features:

Live Bus Tracking: Fetches live bus locations from the OSU API every 15 seconds.

End-to-End Route Planning: Find the fastest path from your "Current Location" or any campus building to another.

Smart Routing Algorithm: Calculates the total trip time by adding four parts:

Walk-to-Stop Time

Wait-for-Bus Time (from live ETA)

Bus-Ride Time

Walk-from-Stop Time

Walk Time Comparison: Immediately see the estimated walking time for your trip.

Real-time Building Search: Search and filter all 200+ OSU campus buildings from a clean UI.

How It Works: The Routing Algorithm

When a user presses "Find Fastest Route," our app's brain (busrouting.js) gets to work.

Run Two Queries: The app immediately runs two calculations at the same time:

Query A (Walk): Calls calculateWalkTime(), which uses the Haversine formula to get the distance in meters, divides it by an average walking speed (1.34 m/s), and saves the totalWalkTime.

Query B (Bus): The main findBestRoute() algorithm begins.

Filter Stops: The algorithm calls findNearbyStops() twice to create two arrays: startStops (all stops within 400m of the start) and endStops (all stops within 400m of the destination).

Find Valid Trips: It enters a nested loop, checking every startStop against every endStop. For a trip to be valid, it must pass two checks:

Same Route: The stops must be on the same bus route.

Correct Direction: It calls isValidDirection(), which checks the route's ordered stop list to ensure the endIndex comes after the startIndex. This is how we solve the "direction" problem.

Get Live ETAs: For every valid trip, it calls findNextBus(), which scans our live bus data (refreshed every 15s) to find the shortest, non-negative timeToArrivalInSeconds for a bus at that stop.

Calculate Total Time: It then calculates the busTravelTime (using live prediction data if possible) and adds all four parts: walkToStopTime + busWaitTime (the live ETA) + busTravelTime + walkFromStopTime.

Find the Winner: After checking all possible trips, the algorithm sorts the final list by totalTime and returns the single bestTrip object. This object is saved to state, which instantly updates the UI to show the user the winning route.

Tech Stack

Core: React Native, JavaScript (ES6+)

Live Data: Official OSU Bus API

Map & UI: react-native-maps, React Native components

Data Processing: Custom-built script to parse GeoJSON building polygons into single-point coordinates.

Collaboration: VS Code Live Share, Git/GitHub

How to run on your device (pre-production):

Prerequisites

Node.js & npm

React Native CLI (npm install -g react-native-cli)

Expo CLI (npm install -g expo-cli)

Xcode (for iOS) or Android Studio (for Android)

Installation & Running

Clone the repo:

git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourUsername]/HackOHI-O.git
cd BuckeyeRoutes


Install dependencies:

npm install


Run:
npm start


Building Data Storage Note:

The buildings.json file in /assets/data was generated from a raw GeoJSON file provided by OSU. A custom script (/scripts/processGeoJSON.js) was written to parse the complex building polygons and calculate their center points. This script does not need to be run unless the source data changes.

Future Work:

This app as it stands right now is just a foundation. Our vision for the future includes:

- FIXES: Handle when route cannot be found better than displaying the error message in the search drawer

- Add support for some buildings outside campus (especially those along the East Residential line) and campus landmarks not in buildings.json (Lincoln Tower Park, The Oval, etc.)

- Smarter search: Search through typos

- Algorithm Updates: Update algorithm to check if riding multiple buses may be more efficient and add that to the route, allow user to set multiple stops.

- Use a maps API to get directions for each step

- Allow user to import their class schedule to see which routes they should take to class.

- Social Features, Smart Notifications: Add safety and accessibility features like "Share My ETA" and notify user of any changes or delays to their route.

- Scheduling: Use bus history to predict which routes should be taken for user-inputted times and destinations.
